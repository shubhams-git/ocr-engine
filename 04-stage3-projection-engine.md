# Stage 3: Financial Projection Engine

## Overview

Stage 3 is where the magic happens – it takes the business insights from Stage 2 and generates comprehensive financial projections for **1, 3, 5, 10, and 15-year horizons**. Our goal is to create a complete **3-way forecast** that shows how your business will perform across different time periods.

## Our 3-Way Forecast Approach

### What is a 3-Way Forecast?
A 3-way forecast integrates three essential financial statements:
1. **Profit & Loss (P&L)**: Revenue, expenses, and profitability
2. **Cash Flow Statement**: How money moves in and out of the business
3. **Balance Sheet**: Assets, liabilities, and equity (always balanced)

### Why We Use 3-Way Forecasting
- **Complete Picture**: Shows not just profits, but cash flow and financial position
- **Financial Integrity**: All three statements must connect mathematically
- **Australian Business Standards**: Aligns with local accounting and business practices
- **Investor Ready**: Provides comprehensive financial projections for stakeholders

## Key Features of Our Projections

### 1. Australian Business Practices
- **Financial Year**: July-June cycles (FY2025 = July 2024 to June 2025)
- **Seasonal Patterns**: Incorporates Australian business seasonality
- **Dividend Policy**: Automatic 40% dividend payout (quarterly distributions)
- **Tax Considerations**: 25% corporate tax rate built into projections

### 2. Transparent Calculation Logic
Every projection includes clear calculation explanations:
```json
{
  "month_1_revenue": {
    "value": 150000,
    "calculation": "Baseline (125000) × Growth (1.05) × Seasonal (1.143) = 150,000",
    "confidence": "high"
  },
  "month_1_gross_profit": {
    "value": 52500,
    "calculation": "Revenue (150000) - Cost of Services (97500) = 52,500",
    "confidence": "high"
  }
}
```

### 3. Scenario Planning
Each projection includes multiple scenarios:
- **Base Case**: Most likely outcome (50-60% probability)
- **Optimistic**: Best-case scenario (25% probability)
- **Conservative**: Cautious scenario (25% probability)

### 3. Confidence-Adjusted Projections
